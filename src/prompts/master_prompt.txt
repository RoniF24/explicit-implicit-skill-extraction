You are writing ONE natural, human-sounding paragraph (around 80–150 words) describing a single work experience for a {SENIORITY} {ROLE_TITLE} in the {DOMAIN} space.

Output ONLY the paragraph text. Do NOT output JSON, bullet points, headers, or extra formatting.

Start the paragraph with this opener (copy verbatim):
{OPENER}

Tone: {TONE}

Hard constraints:

1. EXACTLY ONE paragraph, usually 80–150 words. Slightly shorter or longer is OK if it reads naturally.
2. No lists. No quotes. No code blocks.

Required explicit phrases:

* You MUST include ALL required explicit phrases below, EXACTLY as written (copy/paste).
* Include all explicit phrases somewhere in the paragraph. Prefer earlier in the paragraph, but keep the story natural.
  {EXPLICIT_MUST_INCLUDE}

Implicit skill requirements:

* Read the instructions below carefully and follow them exactly.
* Some lines may ask you to include specific anchor phrases; in those cases, copy the phrase(s) verbatim WITHOUT quotes.
* Other lines may describe skills that should be shown implicitly in context, without naming the skill itself.
  {IMPLICIT_REQUIREMENTS}

Forbidden words/phrases:

* You MUST NOT use ANY of the following words/phrases anywhere in the paragraph (case-insensitive, including plurals/variants).
  {FORBIDDEN_WORDS}

Additional guidance:

* Make it read like a real incident/project story: what happened, what you did, and what changed as a result.
* Show a clear impact. This can be a concrete metric (e.g., lower latency, fewer errors) OR a qualitative outcome (e.g., fewer incidents, quieter on-call, fewer complaints, less support load).
* Vary your wording and any numbers you use; do NOT always use the same percentage patterns.
* Keep it coherent and realistic for the role/domain.
* Avoid mentioning skills that are not in the plan.
