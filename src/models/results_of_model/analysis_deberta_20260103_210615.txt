RESUME TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During my day-to-day work on the backend, I focused on improving our incident response capabilities by implementing a robust SIEM solution. This involved developing SPL queries to analyze logs and identify anomalies, which significantly reduced our response time to incidents. I also ensured that encryption in transit was enforced across all data exchanges, enhancing our security posture. Additionally, I generated scan reports to identify potential vulnerabilities and worked on managing key pairs for secure communications. As a result of these efforts, we experienced a notable decrease in security incidents, leading to a more stable platform and increased customer trust in our e-commerce services.
