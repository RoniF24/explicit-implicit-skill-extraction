You are generating ONE resume-style paragraph for an NLP dataset.

Goal:
Write a realistic resume paragraph that describes concrete work activities.
The paragraph is used to train a model to identify technical skills from text.

Context:
- role_family: {role_family}
- seniority: {seniority}
- responsibility_depth: {responsibility_depth}
- domain: {domain}

Skills specification (JSON dict: skill -> label):
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

Output format:
- ONE paragraph, plain text only
- 4–6 sentences
- Each sentence describes ONE concrete action or responsibility
- No bullet points, no lists, no headings
- Do NOT include quotes, JSON, or any prefacing text

Skill labeling rules:
- For each skill with label 1.0 (EXPLICIT):
  * Mention the canonical skill name OR exactly one alias verbatim
  * Mention it EXACTLY ONCE in the entire paragraph
  * Embed it naturally inside a work sentence
  * Do not repeat it via abbreviations, parentheses, or variations

- For each skill with label 0.5 (IMPLICIT):
  * Do NOT mention the skill name, any alias, or near-synonyms
  * Imply it only through a specific, realistic responsibility
  * Use one clear implication per implicit skill

Hard constraints:
- Use ONLY the skills provided (plus generic words like “server”, “logs”, “database” are ok)
- Do NOT introduce any tools/technologies/frameworks not listed
- Do NOT name companies, products, or proprietary systems unless explicitly in the skills list

Writing style:
- Write like a real {seniority} resume
- Use direct, action-first sentences (e.g., “Implemented…”, “Built…”, “Analyzed…”)
- Avoid marketing language and buzzwords
- Avoid repeating the same idea across sentences
- Avoid these phrases (do not use them):
  “production-grade”, “world-class”, “cutting-edge”, “highly scalable”, “synergy”,
  “worked on”, “responsible for”, “in order to”, “various tasks”, “cross-functional”
- Prefer measurable outcomes if possible WITHOUT adding new tools (e.g., “reduced latency”, “improved uptime”)

Silent final check (do not print the check):
- Every 1.0 skill appears exactly once
- No 0.5 skill name/alias/near-synonym appears
- No unlisted tools appear

Now write the paragraph.
