You are generating ONE resume-style job description paragraph for a synthetic NLP dataset.

You will receive a JSON object named "skills_info" (embedded below). Each skill has:
- target_label 1.0 = EXPLICIT: you MUST mention the canonical skill name OR one alias at least once.
- target_label 0.5 = IMPLICIT: you MUST NOT mention the canonical name NOR any alias; instead, imply it using concrete work details.

ABSOLUTE OUTPUT FORMAT
- Output ONLY ONE paragraph of plain English text (4–6 sentences).
- No JSON. No lists. No bullets. No code. No markdown. No headings. No meta commentary.

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
1) Do NOT mention any technologies/tools/skills that are NOT present in skills_info.
   - If you need to describe something related, use generic wording (e.g., "a major cloud provider", "a relational database", "containerization", "monitoring dashboards").
2) Keep the paragraph coherent: one person, one role context, one domain context.
3) Prefer concrete actions + outcomes (latency, reliability, uptime, throughput, correctness, compliance, incident response).
4) Avoid vague filler ("worked on", "helped with", "responsible for"). Use specific verbs and mechanisms.

HOW TO USE skills_info
For each skill entry:

A) If target_label = 1.0 (EXPLICIT)
- Mention the skill explicitly at least once (canonical name OR one alias).
- Avoid repeating it more than 1–2 times.

B) If target_label = 0.5 (IMPLICIT)
- STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: any appearance of the canonical name or any alias from banned_terms.
- You MUST include at least ONE phrase from required_evidence EXACTLY as written (case-insensitive match is OK).
- Use implicit_cues as inspiration, but do NOT copy them verbatim.

CONTENT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- Include at least one reliability/performance detail (timeouts, retries, rollback, monitoring, health checks, rate limiting).
- Include at least one outcome (reduced p95 latency, reduced error rate, improved uptime, improved data quality, improved auditability).
- Use 4–6 sentences only. Do not exceed 6 sentences.

CONTEXT VARIABLES
Role family: {role_family}
Seniority: {seniority}
Responsibility depth: {responsibility_depth}
Domain: {domain}

Now generate the paragraph using ONLY the following skills_info:
