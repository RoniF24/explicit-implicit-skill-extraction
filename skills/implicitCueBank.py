# skills/implicitCueBank.py
# Hybrid evidence system for IMPLICIT (0.5):
# - Prefer skill-specific evidence phrases (e.g., NLP, MLOps) when available.
# - Otherwise use category evidence phrases.
# - Evidence phrases must NOT include canonical skill names or aliases (no leak),
#   and should avoid naming other skills from your global vector.
