{"job_description": "On a project to modernize our stack, I focused on enhancing our backend services using Ruby, implementing a more efficient data handling process. By optimizing our active record queries, we significantly reduced the response time for user requests, leading to a smoother experience for our customers. Additionally, I introduced WAL mode for our database, which improved write performance and minimized locking issues during peak usage. To ensure data integrity and performance, I also established a VACUUM routine that helped maintain optimal database health. As a result, we saw a noticeable decrease in support tickets related to performance issues, allowing our team to focus on new feature development rather than troubleshooting.
