{"job_description": "In my previous role, I led a project focused on optimizing our telecom data pipeline, which significantly improved data processing speeds. By implementing smart pointers in our C code, I reduced memory leaks and enhanced overall system stability. Additionally, I restructured our database queries to utilize btree indexes, resulting in a 40% decrease in query response times. I also revamped our caching strategy to incorporate TTL eviction, which minimized stale data and improved user experience. Throughout this process, I ensured that file permissions were correctly set to maintain data security and integrity. The successful execution of this project not only streamlined operations but also contributed to a noticeable reduction in support tickets, allowing the team to focus on more strategic initiatives.", "skills": {"C": 1.0, "C++": 0.5, "Linux": 0.5, "PostgreSQL": 0.5, "Redis": 0.5}}
