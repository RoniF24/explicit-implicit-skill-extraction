{"job_description": "I led a team responsible for building reliable backend services using Java 11, ensuring high performance and stability through effective retries and health checks. We integrated Django and Spring Boot frameworks to streamline development and improve system uptime, reducing latency p95 by optimizing JVM configurations and monitoring response times. To enhance data quality checks and schema validation, I implemented validation processes that mitigated potential failures during high concurrency, ensuring compliance with strict SLAs. Additionally, I refined testing environments by incorporating contract tests and status/payload assertions, which reduced test flakiness and improved scalability, ultimately increasing system reliability and auditability.", "skills": {"Java": 1.0, "dbt": 0.5, "Django": 1.0, "Spring Boot": 1.0, "Unit Testing": 0.5}}
{"job_description": "I have led efforts to optimize database performance by implementing index tuning strategies that significantly reduced p99 latency during peak traffic periods. I have also integrated MySQL with robust monitoring and retry mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability, resulting in improved system uptime and correctness. Additionally, I operationalized storage resources with automated scaling, which decreased error rates under strict SLAs and compliance requirements. My work on designing baseline experiments and applying cross-validation techniques contributed to reducing p99 latency and enhancing data quality checks. I used NestJS in production work and ongoing maintenance. These initiatives collectively improved system performance, reliability, and compliance adherence in a high-demand environment.", "skills": {"MySQL": 1.0, "Neo4j": 0.5, "NestJS": 1.0, "dbt": 0.5}}
